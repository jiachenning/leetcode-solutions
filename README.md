The repo is about ninja's solutions. Language is Java. Most of them are from leetcode, and rest of them are from hacker rank, I don't know where them should be located.

Most of them could be optimize for performance issue or code style, they are conflict in most case. It just a solution.

Open for reply, even just a hello.
